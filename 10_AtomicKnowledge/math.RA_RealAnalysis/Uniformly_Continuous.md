- Definition: A function \( f: X \to Y \) is uniformly continuous if for every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta_\epsilon > 0 \) such that for all \( x, y \in X \) with \( |x - y| < \delta_\epsilon \), we have \( |f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon \).

- **[Theorem]** (Contour theorem): If \( f: X \to Y \) is continuous on interval \( [a, b] \), then \( f \) is uniformly continuous on \( [a, b] \).
