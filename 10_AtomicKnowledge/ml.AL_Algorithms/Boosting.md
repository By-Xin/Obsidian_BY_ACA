- Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that can generate a strong learner from a collection of weak learners.
- Two popular boosting algorithms are:
  - [[AdaBoost]]
  - [[Gradient Boosting]]
- Problems with boosting:
  - Cannot be parallelized (each model is dependent on the previous model).
