## Definition of Auto-Correlation Function

Given a stochastic process $X(t)$, the auto-correlation function (ACF) is defined as:

$$
R_X(t,s) = E[X(t)X(s)]
$$

Generally, ACF has the following properties:

- $R_X(t,s) = R_X(s,t)$
- $R_X(t,t) \ge0$
- $|R_X(t,s)| \le\sqrt{R_X(t,t)R_X(s,s)}$
